This is a simple program to search for L1Hs insertions in long-read data. Inserted sequences (currently hard-wired)
at least 500bp are compared with the L1HS reference sequence as well as flanking reference sequences.
A summary of both alignments as well as 5' and 3' TSDs are written for each insertion that aligns with at least
90% identity to L1HS.
